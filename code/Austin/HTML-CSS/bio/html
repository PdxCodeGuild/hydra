					<h2>Background</h2>
							<p>
								Millia lost her parents during the Crusades at a very young age. 
								She was then taken in by Zato, leader of the Assassins Guild. 
								He raised her to be a professional killer just like them and kept getting stronger and stronger with time, earning a position as Zato’s assistant. 
								Eventually, their feelings changed from teacher and student to friends and then lovers. 
								Due to her love for Zato, Millia wanted to be more beneficial to him and obtained the Forbidden Beast that allowed her to use her hair as a weapon. 	
							</p>
							<p>
								As her career as an assassin progressed, Millia’s body count kept piling up after numerous contracts. 
								She began to resent the life of a killer and decided to cut ties with Zato and the Guild. 
								When she was out on a large-scale operation with Zato and other Guild members, she saw an opportunity and fled, leading to Zato and others getting captured. 
								She lived on the run, constantly fighting and evading her pursuers. 
							</p>
							<p>
								In 2180, a word reaches Millia about Zato breaking out of prison and entering the Second Holy Order Selection Tournament. 
								She takes this opportunity to kill him, thinking that it will put an end to her troubles. 
								While she manages to beat him, the tournament turns out to be a trap to revive Justice, and Millia doesn’t get an opportunity to do as she planned. 
								Her life as a fugitive continued. She didn’t give up on trying to kill Zato, however. In exchange for valuable information, she recruited Venom to find Zato’s location. 
								Millia takes him on in a fight and kills Zato but his Shadow Beast, Eddie, takes control of Zato’s body. 
								Without having a living host, it’s only a matter of time before Eddie is gone as well.
							</p>
							<p>
								With the leader of the Assassins Guild dead, Millia tries to lead a normal life. 
								That lasts until Venom informs her that Zato has been resurrected. Despite their past, Millia is relieved to see him alive again. 
								Together with Venom, Slayer, and Zato, they reform Assassins Guild under her leadership while assisting Ky and other allies to handle the Cradle conflict and put down Bedman. 
								After the final battle is successfully resolved, ex-assassins reunite under the banner of the Post-War Administration Bureau, using their skill to serve as an intelligence agency at the service of Illarya.
							</p>
							<p>
								During the incident with I-No and Happy Chaos, king Daryl recruits Millia and Zato for their specialty in informational warfare and intelligence, to the dismay of Leo and Ky, with whom they bond throughout the events. 
								Thanks to their help, Illarya and their allies managed to find information about the special project Tir Na nÓg, which turns the White House into a flying spaceship. 
								After their job is over and I-No is defeated, Zato takes Millia to Venom’s bakery.
