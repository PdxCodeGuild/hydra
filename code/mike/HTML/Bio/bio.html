                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>He was born John Christopher Depp II in Owensboro, Kentucky, on June 9, 1963, to Betty Sue (Wells),
                    who
                    worked as a waitress, and John Christopher Depp, a civil engineer.
                    Depp was raised in Florida. He dropped out of school when he was 15, and fronted a series of
                    music-garage bands, including one named 'The Kids'. When he married Lori Anne Allison (Lori A. Depp)
                    he
                    took a job as a ballpoint-pen salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles,
                    California, with his wife, however, happened to be a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor
                    Nicolas Cage, who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated in Depp's film debut in the
                    low-budget
                    horror film, A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), where he played a teenager who falls prey to
                    dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger.

                <h2>Film Career</h2>
                <p>In 1987 he shot to stardom when he replaced Jeff Yagher in the role of undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the popular TV series 21 Jump Street (1987).
                </p>
                <p>In 1990, after numerous roles in teen-oriented films, his first of a handful of great collaborations
                    with director Tim Burton came about when Depp played the title role in Edward Scissorhands (1990).
                    Following the film's success, Depp carved a niche for himself as a serious, somewhat dark,
                    idiosyncratic
                    performer, consistently selecting roles that surprised critics and audiences alike. He continued to
                    gain
                    critical acclaim and increasing popularity by appearing in many features before re-joining with
                    Burton
                    in the lead role of Ed Wood (1994). In 1997 he played an undercover FBI agent in the fact-based film
                    Donnie Brasco (1997), opposite Al Pacino; in 1998 he appeared in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
                    (1998),
                    directed by Terry Gilliam; and then, in 1999, he appeared in the sci-fi/horror film The Astronaut's
                    Wife
                    (1999). The same year he teamed up again with Burton in Sleepy Hollow (1999), brilliantly portraying
                    Ichabod Crane.
                </p>
                <p>Depp has played many characters in his career, including another fact-based one, Insp. Fred Abberline
                    in
                    From
                    Hell (2001). He stole the show from screen greats such as Antonio Banderas in the finale to Robert
                    Rodriguez's
                    "mariachi" trilogy, Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003). In that same year he starred in the marvelous
                    family
                    blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), playing a character that
                    only
                    the
                    likes of Depp could pull off: the charming, conniving and roguish Capt. Jack Sparrow. The film's
                    enormous
                    success has opened several doors for his career and included an Oscar nomination. He appeared as the
                    central
                    character in the Stephen King-based movie, Secret Window (2004); as the kind-hearted novelist James
                    Barrie in
                    the factually-based Finding Neverland (2004), where he co-starred with Kate Winslet; and Rochester
                    in
                    the
                    British film, The Libertine (2004). Depp collaborated again with Burton in a screen adaptation of
                    Roald
                    Dahl's
                    novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), and later in Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Dark
                    Shadows
                    (2012).
