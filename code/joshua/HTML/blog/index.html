        <h1><a href="#getting-nuclear"> Nuclear Energy Man's <em>Advancement</em> or <em>Demise</em>?</a></h1>
        <h2>Somewhat Man kinds downfall.....</h2>
        <p>
            <em>We all know what happened to Japan..... <strong>TWICE</strong></em>
            If you are reading this and you do not know what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively on the 6 and 9 of August 1945 you need a history lesson.
            And Im fortunately here to help, or unfortunate depends on who you're asking.
            It all started 4 score and 7 years ago... not really.... it did happen 51 years after the Gettysburg Address which imo is not realted at all.
            But in the year of 1914 the first World War started, its actually very intersting that people would like to smash WW1 and WW2 <em>(if you didnt know about World War 1 well NEWS FLASH we had two of them)</em>
            totgrether and refer to that time as the Great War, which is such a deplorable time in out history. Regardless Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was murdered blah blah blah,
            and majoriuty of the world engulfed into conflict... 
            The three most important contries that were involded in the creation of the Nuclear weapon are: <br>
            One.... <br>
            The United States of courese.... since idk we f****** dropped the thing <br>
            And Two ... <br>
            Germany since these a**holes were the ones playing around with nuclear fission and fusion <br>
         
            Germany was working on nuclear technogy first until the Brits and The Candians got involded and sent their finest scicentist to America <em>The Land Of the Free</em>
            Where they were free to work on nuclear technology that would not only take the lives of millions but also threaten the fabric of our realtity today... yea we are talking about you Russia.
            I guess as Americans the term creating your own problems is in out DNA.
            Not to get too sidetracked Germany surrender on May 7, 1945 but alassssssssss the war continued.
            4 years after pearl harbor America finally clapped back but just a bit too far due to how many civiians were murdered. By the way a bit is a huge understatment in total in the matter of seconds,
            94,000 lives were lost.
            The Bomb called Little boy was dropped in Hiroshima at 8:15 in the morning.
            The Bomb called Fat man was dropped at 11:02 am.
            I find it very intresting that an American Air Plane was allowed to travel over enemy territory and just dropped a huge ass bomb... twice like god damn dude.
