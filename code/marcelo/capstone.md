​
**Description:** one source fitness tracker, competition locator, and macro tracker 
​
**What problem does this app solve?**
​
instead of downloading and keeping track of your fitness on multiple apps making navagation confusing and commitment straining. this all in one app will stream line your tracking needs and will work just as hard as you in the gym

## Project Overview
​
What are the major features of your web application? What problem is it attempting to solve? What libraries or frameworks will you use?

website primary feature is outsourcing most of its information from google and have it presented to the user in a friendly easily trackable way. along with it hosting its own database for storage. 
based on a tree and branch design. splash page will have the major categories you can click on that will bring you to a sub domain for that specific category. front page will also have features like locating gyms, trainers for your specific needs and a list of local competitions to get you started. 

on the back-end depending on what the user clicks on the splash page. will have a schedular and a calculator. it will also have different outsource links to click on.

​
## Functionality

splash page
    create profile 
        ** sub domain **
        user input first and last name
        a macro nutrient calculator that will need that ht / wt / and daily schedule to calculate macros needed
    lifting 
        a custom scheduler. that is sectioned out daily for your major lift days. like chest, tri's, bi's, legs, shoulders, and additional misc. in oirder to keep track of your daily/ weekly workouts. to continue the gains!
        
        ### future implmentations of website ##
        
    cardiovascular fitness
        for the runners, rowers, or just simply walking trails. anything that gets your heart rate up and sustained. this will pair with a GPS tracking app and automaticly add the day, distance you traveled and heart rate you sustained.  ( i think this code will be too difficult but i like the concept too much not to add lol)    
    local competitions
        user will input location and will bring up local gyms and links to their schedule and sign up forms 
    
    expansion is working with 3rd party business anhd continue outsourcing. maybe add a link to coaches and training sessions that may interest you. basically compaines that buy into the website to have their product displayed
