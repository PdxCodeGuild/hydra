        <h1>Bruce Lee</h1>
        <p>Bruce Lee (Chinese: 李小龍; Jyutping: Lei5 Siu2 Lung4, born Lee Jun-fan Chinese: 李振藩; Jyutping: Lei5 Zan3 Faan4;
            November 27, 1940 – July 20, 1973) was a Hong Kong and American martial artist, martial arts instructor,
            actor,
            director, screenwriter, producer, and philosopher.[2] He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do, a hybrid martial
            arts
            philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is often credited with paving the way for modern
            mixed
            martial arts (MMA). Lee is considered by critics, media, and other martial artists to be the most
            influential
            martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century, who bridged the gap between East and
            West. He is credited with promoting Hong Kong action cinema and helping to change the way Asians were
            presented
            in American films.[3] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee>Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>

        <p>Lee was the son of Grace Ho and Lee Hoi-chuen, a Cantonese opera star based in Hong Kong. He was born in San
            Francisco in 1940 while his parents were visiting the city for his father's concert tour abroad. The family
            returned to Hong Kong a few months later. He was introduced to the Hong Kong film industry as a child actor
            by
            his father. However these were not martial art films. His early martial arts experience included Wing Chun
            (trained under Yip Man), tai chi, boxing (winning a Hong Kong boxing tournament), and apparently frequent
            street
            fighting (neighbourhood and rooftop fights). In 1959, Lee, having U.S. citizenship due to his birth, was
            able to
            move to Seattle. In 1961, he enrolled in the University of Washington.[4] It was during this time in the
            United
            States that he began considering making money by teaching martial arts even though he aspired an acting
            career.
            He opened his first martial arts school operated out of home in Seattle. After later adding a second school
            in
            Oakland, he once drew significant attention at the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships of
            California by making demonstrations and speaking. He subsequently divested himself and moved to Los Angeles
            to
            teach, where his students included Chuck Norris, Sharon Tate, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. In the 1970s, his
            Hong
            Kong and Hollywood-produced films elevated the Hong Kong martial arts films to a new level of popularity and
            acclaim, sparking a surge of Western interest in Chinese martial arts. The direction and tone of his films
            dramatically influenced and changed martial arts and martial arts films worldwide.[5]</p>
