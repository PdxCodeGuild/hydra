        <blockquote>"Ask for no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal.
            And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day every
            day, sleeping it's life away.
            To hell with that," he said, "shake the tree and knock the great sloth down on his ass."</blockquote>

    <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>

    <p>
        Ray Douglas Bradbury was an American author and screenwriter.
        One of the most celebrated 20th-century American writers, he worked in a variety of modes,
        including fantasy, science fiction, horror, mystery, and realistic fiction.<br><br>

        Bradbury was mainly known for his novel Fahrenheit 451 (1953) and his short-story collections
        The Martian Chronicles (1950) and The Illustrated Man (1951). Most of his best known work is speculative
        fiction, but he also worked in other genres, such as the coming of age novel Dandelion Wine (1957) and the
        fictionalized memoir Green Shadows, White Whale (1992). He also wrote and consulted on screenplays and
        television
        scripts, including Moby Dick and It Came from Outer Space. Many of his works were adapted into television and
        film productions as well as comic books.<br><br>

        The New York Times called Bradbury "the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the
        literary mainstream.
