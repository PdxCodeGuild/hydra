##Define the following functions:

# peaks(data):
# Returns the indices of peaks. 
# A peak has a lower number on both the left and the right.

# valleys(data):
# Returns the indices of 'valleys'. 
# A valley is a number with a higher number on both the left and the right.

# peaks_and_valleys(data):
# Uses the above two functions to compile a single list of the peaks and valleys, 
# in order of appearance in the original data.

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 8, 7, 6, 7, 8, 9]

def peaks(data):
    for num in range(len(data)):
        if num[]
