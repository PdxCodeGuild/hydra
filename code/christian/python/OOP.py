## Lab 1 - COMPLETE

## Bank Account Class
## -Create a Python class called BankAccount which represents a bank account,
## having as attributes: accountNumber (numeric type), name (name of the account owner
## as string type), balance.
## -Create a constructor with parameters: accountNumber, name, balance.
## -Create a deposit() method which manages the deposit actions.
## -Create a withdrawal() method which manages withdrawals actions.
## -Create an bankFees() method to apply the bank fees with a percentage of 5% of the balance account.
## -Create a display() method to display account details.


class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, accountNumber, name, balance):
        self.accountNumber = accountNumber
        self.name = name
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self):
        print(
            f"Thank you {self.name} for choosing to 'Deposit' funds to account number {self.accountNumber}."
        )
        deposit = int(input(f"How much $$$ would you like to deposit? "))
        self.balance += deposit
        print(f"Deposit complete! Yout available funds are now ${self.balance}\n")

    ## Alex's Example
    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
        return self.balance

    def withdrawal(self):
        print(
            f"Thank you {self.name} for choosing to 'Withdrawal' funds from account number {self.accountNumber}."
        )
        withdrawal = int(input(f"How much $$$ would you like to withdrawal? "))
        self.balance -= withdrawal
        print(f"Withdrawal complete! Yout available funds are now ${self.balance}\n")

    ## Alex's Example
    def withdrawal(self, amount):
        self.balance -= amount
        return self.balance

    def bankFees(self):
        bankFees = (self.balance * 0.05) + self.balance
        print(
            f"""\nThank you {self.name} for choosing to bank with 'Hardt Banking'.
To continue providing optimal service, a small banking fee will be applied to your account.
The total charge will be 5% of the valance on account #{self.accountNumber}, or, ${bankFees} in total.
If you have any questions regarding the impending charge, please contact customer service at:

## Lab 2 - COMPLETE
## Rectangle Class
## -Write a Rectangle class in Python language, allowing you to build a rectangle with length and width attributes.
## -Create a perimeter() method to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle and a area() method to calculate the
## area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe rectangle.
## -Create a method display() that display the length, width, perimeter and area of an object created using an
## instantiation on rectangle class.
## -Create a Parallelepipede child class inheriting from the Rectangle class and with a height attribute and another
## volume() method to calculate the volume of the Parallelepiped. ## WHAT????

# -Create a Python class Person with attributes: name and age of type string.
# -Create a display() method that displays the name and age of an object created via the Person class.
# -Create a child class Student which inherits from the Person class and which also has a section attribute.
# -Create a method displayStudent() that displays the name, age and section of an object created via the Student class.
