            Over 900 women purported to have been lovers of the dashing government man were in attendance at his
            funeral. The British Government has gone into mourning and has declared August 13th Sir James Bond day.

            Bond lived fast and well in Japan, Jamaica, Chelsea while in the UK and spent time traveling the entire
            world. Some of his many destiantion are listed <a

            There are several who claim that Bond isnt really dead and that the government is conspiring to cover up the
            fact that he lives to protect him.
